# BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

### I believe my customers have a need to:

- Find Jobs writ large
- Find Jobs based on specific tech stacks
- Find Jobs based on specific locations
- Know which companies use specific tech stacks
- Know where Turing alumni are working or have worked
- Know when a new company using a tech stack we teach starts hiring
- What are the trends in tech stacks over time
- Know which companies we aren't connected with that we should be

### These needs can be solved with:

- Computers

### My initial customers are (or will be):

- Turing Students
- Turing Staff
- Turing Alumni

### The #1 value a customer wants to get out of my service is:

- Jerbs for selves or others

### The customer can also get these additional benefits:

- Trends for Jerbs

### I will acquire the majority of my customers through:

- Turing: Slacktor Beam

### I will make my money by:

- This is unlikely for the immediate future - but potentially partnerships with other companies who could use the service.

### My primary competition in the market will be:

- LinkedIn
- HeadHunters
- Indeed
- Github Jobs
- Built in Colorado
- The jobs sites we actually scrape

### We will beat them due to:

- We know our audience better
- The networking connections & community

Beating them isn't a problem exactly because everything helps

### My biggest product risk is:

- No one using it.
- Dramatic changes to APIs that we use.

### We will solve this through:

- Student Power
- Staff Power
- Alumni Power
- Power

Regular maintenance - good documentation - error handling

### What other assumptions do we have that, if proven false, will cause our business/project to fail:

- Probably that the tools students currently have aren't enough
- Separation/Integration from turing.io?
