You\u2019ll collaborate with the rest of the engineering team on developing new features to our public site as well as our internal applications and assisting with marketing efforts to rapidly test and implement changes to the existing public content. Our ideal candidate will be fluent in HTML and CSS and have experience with preprocessors like HAML, SASS, LESS, Jade, or Stylus. Being a well-rounded JavaScript developer is more important than knowing the latest MV* framework or knowing what bleeding-edge tools are being developed.<\/p><p><strong>About the Tuft & Needle Engineering Team:<\/strong><\/p><p>We view Tuft & Needle not as a mattress company that makes software, but as a software company that sells mattresses. We\u2019re a small team of passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We\u2019re incredibly focused on results and don\u2019t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren\u2019t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well. We aren\u2019t philosophically against formal scrum sprints and stand-ups, but have found our team to work well without them so far.<\/p><p><strong>Our Values:<\/strong><\/p><p>Several months back, we sat down as an engineering team to decide on what our team values are that drive our decisions. The following are a few of these values to give a taste of what we believe as the Tuft & Needle engineering team.<\/p><ul><li>End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.<\/li><li>Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.<\/li><li>Do things that don\u2019t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is \u201cHas the team done this manually first?\u201d. Of course, we\u2019re pragmatic even about this value.<\/li><li>Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it\u2019s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Our Technical Environment:<\/strong><\/p><p>Our stack consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo, Backbone, JavaScript, Middleman, HAML, and SASS running on Heroku. Our codebase has excellent test coverage and we have Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Refactor without fear and ship daily! We also believe in leveraging quality APIs and tools. We use and love Stripe, CircleCI, Segment, Heap Analytics, and Optimizely.<\/p><\/p>","perks":"100% Medical Plan covered for you and your dependents, Unlimited PTO, Flexible schedule, 401k, and more.\n","howto_apply":"","post_date":"2016-04-11 14:19:12","relocation_assistance":0,"telecommuting":1,"category":{"id":"4","name":"Front-end Engineering"},"type":{"id":"1","name":"Full-time"},"company":{"id":"tuftneedle","name":"Tuft & Needle","url":"http:\/\/www.tuftandneedle.com","type":null,"location":{"id":"anywhereintheusa","name":"Anywhere in the U.S.A"},"logo":"https:\/\/d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.net\/uploads\/logos\/fzoyxtx22d65yuoqsg55ticksowxx7lh\/thumb\/tn_profile.png","hero":"https:\/\/d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.net\/uploads\/heroes\/fzoyxtx22d65yuoqsg55ticksowxx7lh\/tn_hero.jpg","tagline":"Tuft & Needle is a software company that makes mattresses."},"keywords":"team,believe,engineering,have,software,were,what,features,test,needle,tuft,developer,continuous,about,important,being,javascript,should,things,sass,knowing,arent,company,office,dont,although,from,tools,each,frontend","apply_url":"https:\/\/jobs.lever.co\/tuftandneedle\/e9640b99-c5fd-4b6d-8a7b-49cfc316f324","url":"https:\/\/authenticjobs.com\/jobs\/27126\/front-end-developer"},{"id":"27094","title":"Web Developer","description":"<p><p>We\u2019re a two person partnership located in the oh-so-hip RiNo area of Denver, where we\u2019ve been quietly creating usable and maintainable interactive solutions for our clients.
